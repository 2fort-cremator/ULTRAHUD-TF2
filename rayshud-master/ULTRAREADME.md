Hey, 2fort Cremator here. I'm the solo developer of ULTRAHUD.

This HUD was made as a way for me to bring the HUD of Ultrakill to TF2.

I don't know much about HUD development, and my previous attempts died before they even started, I made the choice to base this off of Rayshud because it's a simple, easy to edit HUD. Updates may be very sparse, as I go to high school and have to study a lot. 

If you downloaded this HUD (off my google drive or other sources), thanks.

Credits:

Raysfire - Rayshud and the tutorials that helped me make this.

Hakita & the ULTRAKILL dev team - Made one of my favorite games and inspired me to pick up HUD development.
