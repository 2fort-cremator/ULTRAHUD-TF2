Here you can find all of the customizations that ULTRAHUD has to offer.

ACTIVATION:

Drop the folder or file into the "ENABLED" folder, and use the "HUD RELOAD +" option in the utilites section of the Calibration screen for the changes to take effect*.

*It is still recommended to fully restart your game, and the custom colors will need a game restart to apply.
